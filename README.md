A simple Clojure PostgreSQL-based job queue. An optional web UI is also available as both a [library][cljobq-web] and a [standalone service][cljobq-web-server].

```clojure
[cljobq "0.1.2"] ; add this to your project.clj
```

## Usage

See the [API documentation][API] for more detailed usage information, including examples.

  (println "a * b =" (* a b))
  (Thread/sleep 20000))
